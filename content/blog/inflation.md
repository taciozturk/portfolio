## Overview

IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies applies where an entity's functional currency is that of a
hyperinflationary economy. The standard does not prescribe when hyperinflation arises but requires the financial
statements (and corresponding figures for previous periods) of an entity with a functional currency that is
hyperinflationary to be restated for the changes in the general pricing power of the functional currency.
IAS 29 was issued in July 1989 and is operative for periods beginning on or after 1 January 1990.

## Summary of IAS 29

### Objective of IAS 29

The objective of IAS 29 is to establish specific standards for entities reporting in the currency of a hyperinflationary
economy, so that the financial information provided is meaningful.

### Restatement of financial statements

The basic principle in IAS 29 is that the financial statements of an entity that reports in the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy should be stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date. Comparative
figures for prior period(s) should be restated into the same current measuring unit. [IAS 29.8]
Restatements are made by applying a general price index. Items such as monetary items that are already stated at the
measuring unit at the balance sheet date are not restated. Other items are restated based on the change in the general
price index between the date those items were acquired or incurred and the balance sheet date.
A gain or loss on the net monetary position is included in net income. It should be disclosed separately. [IAS 29.9]
The restated amount of a non-monetary item is reduced, in accordance with appropriate IFRSs, when it exceeds its the
recoverable amount. [IAS 29.19]
The Standard does not establish an absolute rate at which hyperinflation is deemed to arise - but allows judgement as to
when restatement of financial statements becomes necessary. Characteristics of the economic environment of a country
which indicate the existence of hyperinflation include: [IAS 29.3]
the general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency.
Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power;
the general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable
foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency;
sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the
credit period, even if the period is short;
interest rates, wages, and prices are linked to a price index; and
the cumulative inflation rate over three years approaches, or exceeds, 100%.
IAS 29 describes characteristics that may indicate that an economy is hyperinflationary. However, it concludes that it
is a matter of judgement when restatement of financial statements becomes necessary.
When an economy ceases to be hyperinflationary and an entity discontinues the preparation and presentation of financial
statements in accordance with IAS 29, it should treat the amounts expressed in the measuring unit current at the end of
the previous reporting period as the basis for the carrying amounts in its subsequent financial statements. [IAS 29.38]

### Disclosure

Gain or loss on monetary items [IAS 29.9]
The fact that financial statements and other prior period data have been restated for changes in the general purchasing
power of the reporting currency [IAS 29.39]
Whether the financial statements are based on an historical cost or current cost approach [IAS 29.39]
Identity and level of the price index at the balance sheet date and moves during the current and previous reporting
period [IAS 29.39]

### Which jurisdictions are hyperinflationary?

IAS 29 defines and provides general guidance for assessing whether a particular jurisdiction's economy is
hyperinflationary. But the IASB does not identify specific jurisdictions.
There are, however, two reliable sources for this kind of information:
The International Practices Task Force (IPTF) of the Centre for Audit Quality monitors the status of 'highly
inflationary' countries. While it monitors the status of highly inflationary countries for the purposes of applying US
GAAP, its criteria for identifying such countries are similar to those for identifying 'hyperinflationary economies'
under IAS 29. From time to time, the IPTF issues reports of its discussions with SEC staff on the IPTF's recommendations
of which countries should be considered highly inflationary, and which countries are on the Task Force's inflation '
watch list'. The newest available IPTF list is dated 9 November 2023. The full list, including exact numbers, detailed
explanations of the calculation of the numbers, and observations of the Task Force is available on the CAQ website. It
lists the following countries as hyperinflationary economies:

- Argentina
- Ethiopia
- Ghana
- Iran
- Lebanon
- Sierra Leone
- Sudan
- Suriname
- Turkey
- Venezuela
- Yemen
- Zimbabwe

In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) publishes inflation forecasts. Applying the indicators laid out in
IAS 29, the following economies should be considered hyperinflationary economies for the purposes of applying IAS 29 and
for retranslation of foreign operations in accordance with IAS 21 The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates in
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2023:

- Argentina
- Ethiopia
- Ghana
- Haiti
- Iran
- Lebanon
- Sierra Leone
- Sudan
- Suriname
- Syria
- Turkey
- Venezuela
- Yemen
- Zimbabwe
